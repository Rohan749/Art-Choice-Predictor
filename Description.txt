Hey everyone, my name is Rohan Kumar Pandey, undergraduate engineering student, 1st year ECE at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering Banglore.
Recently I completed learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and created a project.
I don't know when I will upload this project because I don't know Git and GitHub yet. Maybe when I will complete my backend then I will surely upload.
Its a really nice idea in which the webpage will predict a person's interest in a particular art field using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Technically I am an artist, so this skill has really helped me in designing the webpage. Furthermore, it took me less time in getting good at 
all the color combinations and transition effects, hover, box shadow, background image etc and putting it into my creation.
So my project is completely based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the predictions are evaluated based on the time spent in looking at a 
particular art image. It uses JavaScript's setInterval concept. 
When I learned setInterval, I came to know that it repeatedly calls a particular function after a given time(in milliseconds, like you have to write
1000 for 1sec, after writing function name). So I thought why not to define a function there itself which increment a variable after each second, by 1.
In that way the variable increments will give us the time incremented.
Furthermore, If that function is connected to event "mouseover" for a particular div container in which a image is kept, it will calculate the time spent
when mouse was inside the div container, or we can say time spent when the user was looking at the particular image. The more the time spent, the more
interested the user is in that image. But I was really having problem because I never called any function to stop the setInterval. Also one more thing 
I realised that if setInterval is not stopped and mouse is again hovered over the div container in which it is connected, it will add up the previous 
setInterval to a new called setInterval and the increment of the variable will get faster than previous time duration declared(here I declared 1000). 
I fixed this problem by calling another function clearInterval and connecting this to event "mouseout".  I don't know but maybe somewhere I would put 
this issue into a good use. Further I made the interval duration from 1000 to 50 so that intervals will be 
short to increment the variable and time spent in each image will be more easily differetiated.
I have learned a lot from this project and I would continue to learn more and grow.
And also do check my creations on instagram - "rohanpandey749". I would be really happy.
